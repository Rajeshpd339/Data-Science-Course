Q1. What is Ridge Regression, and how does it differ from ordinary least squares regression?

Ridge Regression: It is a regularized linear regression technique that adds a penalty term to the ordinary least squares (OLS) regression cost function. The penalty term is proportional to the square of the magnitude of the coefficients.
Cost
=
OLS Cost
Cost=OLS Cost+λ∑ 
Differences:

Regularization Term: Ridge includes a regularization term, which is absent in OLS.
Shrinkage of Coefficients: Ridge tends to shrink the coefficients towards zero, preventing overfitting.
Q2. What are the assumptions of Ridge Regression?

Assumptions:
Linearity: The relationship between independent and dependent variables is linear.
Independence: Residuals are independent.
Homoscedasticity: Residuals have constant variance.
Normality: Residuals are normally distributed.
Q3. How do you select the value of the tuning parameter (lambda) in Ridge Regression?

Cross-Validation: The value of 
�
λ is typically selected through cross-validation. Different values are tried, and the one that minimizes the mean squared error on validation sets is chosen.
Q4. Can Ridge Regression be used for feature selection? If yes, how?

Yes, to some extent: Ridge Regression tends to shrink the coefficients towards zero but rarely exactly to zero. While it mitigates multicollinearity, it does not perform explicit feature selection. Lasso Regression is more suitable for feature selection as it can drive some coefficients exactly to zero.
Q5. How does the Ridge Regression model perform in the presence of multicollinearity?

Performance in Multicollinearity: Ridge Regression is particularly useful when multicollinearity is present. It stabilizes the coefficient estimates and prevents them from becoming too large in the presence of highly correlated predictors.
Q6. Can Ridge Regression handle both categorical and continuous independent variables?

Yes: Ridge Regression can handle both categorical and continuous variables. However, for categorical variables, dummy coding or other encoding techniques may be necessary.
Q7. How do you interpret the coefficients of Ridge Regression?

Interpretation: The coefficients in Ridge Regression represent the change in the dependent variable for a one-unit change in the corresponding independent variable, considering the influence of all other variables. However, due to regularization, direct interpretation can be challenging.
Q8. Can Ridge Regression be used for time-series data analysis? If yes, how?

Yes: Ridge Regression can be adapted for time-series data by considering lagged values of the dependent variable or other relevant time-series features as predictors. However, when dealing with time-series data, other specialized methods such as autoregressive models may be more suitable. Ridge Regression may be used in a broader feature selection or regularization context within a time-series analysis framework.
