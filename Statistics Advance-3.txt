Q1: What is Estimation Statistics? Explain point estimate and interval estimate.
Estimation Statistics: Estimation involves using sample data to make inferences about population parameters. It provides a range of plausible values for an unknown parameter.

Point Estimate: A single value that is used to estimate the population parameter. Example: The sample mean (
�
ˉ
X
ˉ
 ) is a point estimate for the population mean (
�
μ).

Interval Estimate: A range of values used to estimate the population parameter. It includes both a point estimate and a margin of error. Example: A confidence interval for the population mean.

Q2: Write a Python function to estimate the population mean using a sample mean and standard deviation.
python
Copy code
import math

def estimate_population_mean(sample_mean, sample_std_dev, sample_size, confidence_level=0.95):
    # Calculate margin of error using the t-distribution
    margin_of_error = stats.t.ppf((1 + confidence_level) / 2, df=sample_size - 1) * (sample_std_dev / math.sqrt(sample_size))

    # Calculate confidence interval
    lower_bound = sample_mean - margin_of_error
    upper_bound = sample_mean + margin_of_error

    return lower_bound, upper_bound

# Example usage
sample_mean = 50
sample_std_dev = 10
sample_size = 30
confidence_level = 0.95
result = estimate_population_mean(sample_mean, sample_std_dev, sample_size, confidence_level)
print(f'Estimated population mean: {result}')
Q3: What is Hypothesis testing? Why is it used? State the importance of Hypothesis testing.
Hypothesis Testing: A statistical method used to make inferences about population parameters based on a sample of data. It involves formulating null and alternative hypotheses, collecting and analyzing data, and drawing conclusions about the population.

Importance of Hypothesis Testing:

Decision Making: Helps in making decisions and drawing conclusions about population parameters.
Scientific Research: Essential in scientific research to validate or reject hypotheses.
Quality Control: Used in quality control to ensure product specifications are met.
Q4: Create a hypothesis that states whether the average weight of male college students is greater than the average weight of female college students.
Hypothesis:

Null Hypothesis (
�
0
H 
0
​
 ): The average weight of male college students is equal to or less than the average weight of female college students (
�
male
≤
�
female
μ 
male
​
 ≤μ 
female
​
 ).
Alternative Hypothesis (
�
1
H 
1
​
 ): The average weight of male college students is greater than the average weight of female college students (
�
male
>
�
female
μ 
male
​
 >μ 
female
​
 ).
Q5: Write a Python script to conduct a hypothesis test on the difference between two population means, given a sample from each population.
python
Copy code
import scipy.stats as stats

def two_sample_t_test(sample1, sample2):
    _, p_value = stats.ttest_ind(sample1, sample2)
    return p_value

# Example usage
sample_male = [70, 72, 75, 68, 71]
sample_female = [65, 68, 72, 66, 69]

p_value = two_sample_t_test(sample_male, sample_female)
print(f'P-value: {p_value}')
Q6: What is a null and alternative hypothesis? Give some examples.
Null Hypothesis (�\0H 0): A statement that there is no significant difference, effect, or relationship. Example: The mean weight of a drug-treated group is equal to the mean weight of a control group.

Alternative Hypothesis (�1H 1
​
  or ��H a): A statement that contradicts the null hypothesis, suggesting a significant difference, effect, or relationship. Example: The mean weight of a drug-treated group is different from the mean weight of a control group.

Q7: Write down the steps involved in hypothesis testing.
Formulate Hypotheses:

Null Hypothesis (�0H 0): Assumes no effect or no difference.
Alternative Hypothesis (�1H 1): Assumes an effect or difference.
Collect Data:

Collect relevant data through experiments or observations.
Choose Significance Level (�α):
Decide the level of significance (e.g., 0.05), which determines the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is true.
Conduct Test:

Use an appropriate statistical test to analyze the data.
Draw Conclusion:

Based on the test results, either reject or fail to reject the null hypothesis.
Q8: Define p-value and explain its significance in hypothesis testing.
P-value: The probability of observing a test statistic as extreme as, or more extreme than, the one observed, assuming the null hypothesis is true.

Significance in Hypothesis Testing:

A small p-value (
<
�
<α) suggests evidence against the null hypothesis.
A large p-value (
>
�
>α) suggests insufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis.
Commonly used significance levels are 0.05 or 0.01.
Q9: Generate a Student's t-distribution plot using Python's matplotlib library, with the degrees of freedom parameter set to 10.
python
Copy code
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
import scipy.stats as stats

# Generate t-distribution plot
degrees_of_freedom = 10
x = np.linspace(-4, 4, 1000)
y = stats.t.pdf(x, df=degrees_of_freedom)

plt.plot(x, y, label=f't-Distribution (df={degrees_of_freedom})')
plt.title("Student's t-Distribution")
plt.xlabel('x')
plt.ylabel('Probability Density')
plt.legend()
plt.show()
Q10: Write a Python program to calculate the two-sample t-test for independent samples, given two random samples of equal size and a null hypothesis that the population means are equal.
python
Copy code
import scipy.stats as stats

def two_sample_t_test(sample1, sample2):
    _, p_value = stats.ttest_ind(sample1, sample2)
    return p_value

# Example usage
sample1 = [23, 25, 22, 20, 27]
sample2 = [18, 21, 24, 19, 23]

p_value = two_sample_t_test(sample1, sample2)
print(f'P-value: {p_value}')


### Q11: What is Student’s t distribution? When to use the t-Distribution.

**Student’s t Distribution:**
- A probability distribution used in statistical inference.
- Similar to the normal distribution but wider and shaped like a bell curve.
- Dependent on degrees of freedom (sample size - 1).

**When to Use the t-Distribution:**
- Small sample sizes (<30) when population standard deviation is unknown.
- Used in hypothesis testing and confidence intervals for means.

### Q12: What is t-statistic? State the formula for t-statistic.

**t-Statistic:** A measure used in hypothesis testing when the population standard deviation is unknown.

**Formula:**
\[ t = \frac{{\bar{X} - \mu}}{{s / \sqrt{n}}} \]

Where:
- \(\bar{X}\) is the sample mean.
- \(\mu\) is the population mean.
- \(s\) is the sample standard deviation.
- \(n\) is the sample size.
