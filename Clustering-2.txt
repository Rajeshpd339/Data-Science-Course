Q1. Hierarchical Clustering:

Hierarchical clustering is a clustering technique that creates a tree of clusters, known as a dendrogram. Unlike partitioning methods like K-Means, hierarchical clustering does not require a predefined number of clusters. It is different from other clustering techniques in that it produces a tree-like structure of nested clusters, allowing for both top-down (divisive) and bottom-up (agglomerative) approaches.

Q2. Types of Hierarchical Clustering:

Divisive (Top-Down): Starts with all data points in one cluster and recursively divides them into smaller clusters until each data point is a separate cluster.

Agglomerative (Bottom-Up): Starts with each data point as a single cluster and iteratively merges the closest clusters until all data points belong to one cluster.

Q3. Distance Between Clusters:

The distance between two clusters can be determined using various distance metrics, including:

Single Linkage: Minimum distance between any two points in the two clusters.
Complete Linkage: Maximum distance between any two points in the two clusters.
Average Linkage: Average distance between all pairs of points in the two clusters.
Centroid Linkage: Distance between the centroids of the two clusters.
Q4. Determining Optimal Number of Clusters:

Methods for determining the optimal number of clusters in hierarchical clustering include:

Dendrogram: Visually inspect the dendrogram and choose a suitable number of clusters.
Cutting the Dendrogram: Observe the height at which to cut the dendrogram, resulting in the desired number of clusters.
Cophenetic Correlation Coefficient: Measure of how faithfully a dendrogram preserves pairwise distances.
Q5. Dendrograms:

Dendrograms are tree diagrams that represent the hierarchical structure of clusters. They display the order and distances at which clusters are merged or split. Dendrograms help in visualizing the clustering process and deciding on the number of clusters to retain.

Q6. Handling Numerical and Categorical Data:

For numerical data, standard distance metrics (Euclidean, Manhattan) can be used.
For categorical data, specialized distance metrics (Jaccard, Dice, Hamming) are employed to measure dissimilarity based on category matching.
Q7. Identifying Outliers with Hierarchical Clustering:

Outliers or anomalies can be identified by examining clusters in the dendrogram that are significantly smaller than others. Data points in such clusters may represent outliers, as they do not merge with other points until later stages of clustering.
