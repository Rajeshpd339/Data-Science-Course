Q1. Different Types of Clustering Algorithms:

Clustering algorithms can be broadly categorized into several types based on their approach and underlying assumptions:

Hierarchical Clustering:

Divisive: Top-down approach, starts with the whole dataset as one cluster and recursively splits.
Agglomerative: Bottom-up approach, starts with each data point as a cluster and merges them iteratively.
Partitioning Methods:

K-Means: Divides data into k clusters based on centroids.
K-Medoids: Similar to K-Means but uses medoids (actual data points) as cluster centers.
Density-Based Methods:

DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise): Identifies clusters based on dense regions in data.
Model-Based Methods:

Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM): Assumes that data points are generated from a mixture of Gaussian distributions.
Fuzzy Clustering:

Fuzzy C-Means: Allows data points to belong to multiple clusters with varying degrees of membership.
Self-Organizing Maps (SOM):

Neural network-based approach that represents data in a lower-dimensional space.
Each type of clustering algorithm has its strengths, weaknesses, and use cases.

Q2. K-Means Clustering:

K-Means is a partitioning method that separates data into K clusters. The algorithm works as follows:

Initialize K centroids randomly.
Assign each data point to the nearest centroid, forming clusters.
Update the centroids by taking the mean of all data points in each cluster.
Repeat steps 2-3 until convergence.
Q3. Advantages and Limitations of K-Means:

Advantages:

Simple and easy to implement.
Scales well to large datasets.
Efficient for globular-shaped clusters.
Limitations:

Assumes clusters are spherical and equally sized.
Sensitive to the initial placement of centroids.
May converge to local optima.
Q4. Determining Optimal Number of Clusters in K-Means:

Elbow Method: Plot the sum of squared distances to the centroid for different values of K and choose the "elbow" point where the rate of decrease slows.
Silhouette Score: Measure of how similar an object is to its own cluster compared to other clusters.
Gap Statistics: Compare the sum of squared distances of clusters to a random distribution.
Q5. Applications of K-Means Clustering:

Image segmentation.
Customer segmentation in marketing.
Anomaly detection in cybersecurity.
Document clustering in natural language processing.
Q6. Interpreting K-Means Output:

Centroids represent cluster centers.
Each data point is assigned to the cluster with the nearest centroid.
Analyzing cluster characteristics helps interpret the meaning of each cluster.
Q7. Challenges in Implementing K-Means:

Sensitivity to initial centroids.
Difficulty handling clusters of different sizes and densities.
Requires predefined number of clusters.
