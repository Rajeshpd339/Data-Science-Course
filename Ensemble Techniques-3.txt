### Q1. What is Random Forest Regressor?

**Random Forest Regressor** is an ensemble learning algorithm that belongs to the family of decision tree-based models. It is used for regression tasks, where the goal is to predict a continuous numeric output. Random Forest Regressor builds multiple decision trees during training and outputs the average prediction of the individual trees as the final prediction.

### Q2. How Does Random Forest Regressor Reduce the Risk of Overfitting?

Random Forest Regressor reduces the risk of overfitting through the following mechanisms:

- **Bootstrap Sampling:** Each decision tree in the forest is trained on a random subset of the training data, drawn with replacement (bootstrap sampling). This introduces diversity among the trees and helps prevent overfitting to specific patterns in the training data.

- **Feature Randomization:** At each split in the decision tree, only a random subset of features is considered. This further adds diversity to the trees and reduces the likelihood of individual trees overfitting to specific features.

- **Averaging Predictions:** The final prediction of the Random Forest Regressor is the average of predictions from individual trees. Averaging smoothens out the impact of noisy data points, contributing to a more robust and generalizable model.

### Q3. How Does Random Forest Regressor Aggregate the Predictions of Multiple Decision Trees?

Random Forest Regressor aggregates predictions through the averaging of individual decision tree predictions. For each input sample, each decision tree in the forest independently provides a numeric prediction. The final prediction of the Random Forest Regressor is the average (or sometimes the median) of these individual predictions.

### Q4. What Are the Hyperparameters of Random Forest Regressor?

Some key hyperparameters of the Random Forest Regressor include:

- **n_estimators:** The number of decision trees in the forest.
- **max_depth:** The maximum depth of each decision tree.
- **min_samples_split:** The minimum number of samples required to split an internal node.
- **min_samples_leaf:** The minimum number of samples required to be in a leaf node.
- **max_features:** The number of features to consider when looking for the best split.

These hyperparameters control the complexity of the individual trees and the overall behavior of the Random Forest.

### Q5. Difference Between Random Forest Regressor and Decision Tree Regressor?

- **Random Forest Regressor:** Builds multiple decision trees and aggregates their predictions. Utilizes bootstrap sampling and feature randomization to reduce overfitting.

- **Decision Tree Regressor:** A single decision tree used for regression tasks. Can be prone to overfitting, especially with deep trees.

### Q6. Advantages and Disadvantages of Random Forest Regressor:

**Advantages:**
- High predictive accuracy.
- Robust to overfitting, thanks to ensemble techniques.
- Handles a large number of features and captures complex relationships.

**Disadvantages:**
- Can be computationally expensive due to multiple trees.
- Harder to interpret compared to a single decision tree.

### Q7. What is the Output of Random Forest Regressor?

The output of a Random Forest Regressor is a continuous numeric prediction for each input sample. For a given input, each decision tree in the forest produces a prediction, and the final output is the average (or median) of these individual predictions.

### Q8. Can Random Forest Regressor Be Used for Classification Tasks?

While Random Forest Regressor is designed for regression tasks, a closely related algorithm called **Random Forest Classifier** is used for classification tasks. The main difference lies in the type of output variable they predict (continuous for regression, categorical for classification). The principles of ensemble learning and tree-based modeling are similar in both cases.
