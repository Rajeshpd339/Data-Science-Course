### Q1: What is the difference between a t-test and a z-test? Provide an example scenario where you would use each type of test.

- T-test:
  - Used when the sample size is small (typically less than 30).
  - Appropriate when the population standard deviation is unknown.
  - Example: Testing whether there is a significant difference in the mean scores of two groups (e.g., Group A and Group B) where the sample size is small.

- Z-test:
  - Used when the sample size is large (typically greater than 30).
  - Appropriate when the population standard deviation is known.
  - Example: Testing whether the mean height of a sample of 100 individuals is significantly different from the population mean height.

### Q2: Differentiate between one-tailed and two-tailed tests.

- One-tailed test:
  - Used when the research hypothesis specifies the direction of the effect (e.g., greater than or less than).
  - Example: Testing whether a new drug leads to a significant increase in test scores.

- Two-tailed test:
  - Used when the research hypothesis does not specify the direction of the effect.
  - Example: Testing whether a new teaching method has a different effect on test scores, without specifying whether it increases or decreases scores.

### Q3: Explain the concept of Type 1 and Type 2 errors in hypothesis testing. Provide an example scenario for each type of error.

- Type 1 Error (False Positive):
  - Incorrectly rejecting a true null hypothesis.
  - Example: Concluding that a person is guilty when they are innocent in a criminal trial.

- Type 2 Error (False Negative):
  - Failing to reject a false null hypothesis.
  - Example: Concluding that a new drug is not effective when it actually is.

### Q4: Explain Bayes's theorem with an example.

- Bayes's Theorem:
  - A mathematical formula that calculates the probability of a hypothesis given prior knowledge.
  - \( P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \)

- Example:
  - Probability of having a cold (A) given the symptom of sneezing (B).
  - \( P(A) \) is the prior probability of having a cold.
  - \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of sneezing given a cold.
  - \( P(B) \) is the overall probability of sneezing.
  - \( P(A|B) \) is the updated probability of having a cold given sneezing.

### Q5: What is a confidence interval? How to calculate the confidence interval, explain with an example.

- Confidence Interval:
  - A range of values that likely contains the true value of a population parameter.

- Calculation:
  - \( \text{Confidence Interval} = \text{Sample Mean} \pm (\text{Critical Value} \times \text{Standard Error}) \)

- Example:
  - Calculating a 95% confidence interval for the mean height of a population with a sample mean of 65 inches, a standard deviation of 3 inches, and a sample size of 30.

### Q6. Use Bayes' Theorem to calculate the probability of an event occurring given prior knowledge of the event's probability and new evidence. Provide a sample problem and solution.

- Example:
  - Probability of having a rare genetic disorder (Event A) given a positive genetic test result (Event B).
  - \( P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \)

### Q7. Calculate the 95% confidence interval for a sample of data with a mean of 50 and a standard deviation of 5. Interpret the results.

- Calculation:
  - Assuming a normal distribution, the critical value for a 95% confidence interval is approximately 1.96.
  - \( \text{Confidence Interval} = 50 \pm (1.96 \times \frac{5}{\sqrt{n}}) \)
- Interpretation:
  - We are 95% confident that the true population mean falls within the range of the calculated confidence interval, which is (47.04, 52.96).

### Q8. What is the margin of error in a confidence interval? How does sample size affect the margin of error? Provide an example of a scenario where a larger sample size would result in a smaller margin of error.

- Margin of Error:
  - The range above and below the sample statistic within which the true population parameter is likely to fall.

- Sample Size Effect:
  - As the sample size increases, the margin of error decreases.

- Example:
  - Comparing the margin of error for a confidence interval with a sample size of 100 versus a sample size of 500. A larger sample size would result in a smaller margin of error.

### Q9. Calculate the z-score for a data point with a value of 75, a population mean of 70, and a population standard deviation of 5. Interpret the results.

- Calculation:
  - \( Z = \frac{X - \mu}{\sigma} \)

- Interpretation:
  - A z-score of 1 indicates that the data point is 1 standard deviation above the mean.

### Q10. In a study of the effectiveness of a new weight loss drug, a sample of 50 participants lost an average of 6 pounds with a standard deviation of 2.5 pounds. Conduct a hypothesis test to determine if the drug is significantly effective at a 95% confidence level using a t-test.

- Hypothesis Test:
  - Null Hypothesis (\(H_0\)): The mean weight loss is not significant (\(\mu = 0\)).
  - Alternative Hypothesis (\(H_1\)): The mean weight loss is significant (\(\mu \neq 0\)).

- Calculation:
  - Use a t-test formula with the sample mean, standard deviation, sample size, and a significance level of 0.05.

### Q11. In a survey of 500 people, 65% reported being satisfied with their current job. Calculate the 95% confidence interval for the true proportion of people who are satisfied with their job.

- Calculation:
  - Assuming a normal distribution, the critical value for a 95% confidence interval is approximately 1.96.
  - \( \text{Confidence Interval} = p \pm (1.96 \times \sqrt{\frac{p(1-p)}{n}}) \)
  - Where \( p \) is the sample proportion and \( n \) is the sample size.

- Interpretation:
  - We are 95% confident that the true proportion of people satisfied with their job falls within the calculated confidence interval.
### Q12. A researcher is testing the effectiveness of two different teaching methods on student performance. Sample A has a mean score of 85 with a standard deviation of 6, while sample B has a mean score of 82 with a standard deviation of 5. Conduct a hypothesis test to determine if the two teaching methods have a significant difference in student performance using a t-test with a significance level of 0.01.

- Hypothesis Test:
  - Null Hypothesis (\(H_0\)): There is no significant difference in the mean scores of the two teaching methods (\(\mu_A = \mu_B\)).
  - Alternative Hypothesis (\(H_1\)): There is a significant difference in the mean scores of the two teaching methods (\(\mu_A \neq \mu_B\)).

- Calculation:
  - Use a two-sample t-test formula with the sample means, standard deviations, sample sizes, and a significance level of 0.01.

```python
import scipy.stats as stats

# Given data for Sample A
mean_A = 85
std_dev_A = 6
sample_size_A =  # specify the sample size for Sample A

# Given data for Sample B
mean_B = 82
std_dev_B = 5
sample_size_B =  # specify the sample size for Sample B

# Significance level
alpha = 0.01

# Two-sample t-test
t_statistic, p_value = stats.ttest_ind_from_stats(mean_A, std_dev_A, sample_size_A, mean_B, std_dev_B, sample_size_B)

# Compare p-value with significance level
if p_value < alpha:
    print("Reject the null hypothesis. There is a significant difference in student performance.")
else:
    print("Fail to reject the null hypothesis. There is no significant difference in student performance.")
```

### Q13. A population has a mean of 60 and a standard deviation of 8. A sample of 50 observations has a mean of 65. Calculate the 90% confidence interval for the true population mean.

- **Calculation:**
  - Assuming a normal distribution, the critical value for a 90% confidence interval is approximately 1.645.
  - \( \text{Confidence Interval} = \bar{x} \pm (1.645 \times \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}) \)

```python
import math

# Given data
population_mean = 60
population_std_dev = 8
sample_mean = 65
sample_size = 50

# Critical value for a 90% confidence interval
critical_value = 1.645

# Confidence Interval calculation
margin_of_error = critical_value * (population_std_dev / math.sqrt(sample_size))
confidence_interval = (sample_mean - margin_of_error, sample_mean + margin_of_error)

print(f'90% Confidence Interval: {confidence_interval}')
```

### Q14. In a study of the effects of caffeine on reaction time, a sample of 30 participants had an average reaction time of 0.25 seconds with a standard deviation of 0.05 seconds. Conduct a hypothesis test to determine if caffeine has a significant effect on reaction time at a 90% confidence level using a t-test.

- Hypothesis Test:
  - Null Hypothesis (\(H_0\)): Caffeine has no significant effect on reaction time (\(\mu = 0\)).
  - Alternative Hypothesis (\(H_1\)): Caffeine has a significant effect on reaction time (\(\mu \neq 0\)).

- **Calculation:**
  - Use a one-sample t-test formula with the sample mean, standard deviation, sample size, and a significance level of 0.10.

```python
# Given data
sample_mean_caffeine = 0.25
std_dev_caffeine = 0.05
sample_size_caffeine = 30

# Significance level
alpha_caffeine = 0.10

# One-sample t-test
t_statistic_caffeine, p_value_caffeine = stats.ttest_1samp([sample_mean_caffeine]*sample_size_caffeine, 0)

# Compare p-value with significance level
if p_value_caffeine < alpha_caffeine:
    print("Reject the null hypothesis. Caffeine has a significant effect on reaction time.")
else:
    print("Fail to reject the null hypothesis. Caffeine has no significant effect on reaction time.")
```
